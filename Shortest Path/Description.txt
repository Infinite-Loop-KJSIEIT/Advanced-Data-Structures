This programme receives a weighted graph as its input and generates a tree with shortest paths with respect to a user-specified vertex.

In this programme, every vertex is represented by a unique integer and a map is used to store the edges and their weights of the graph originiting from each vertex.

The programme implements the Dijkstra's algorithm to build the tree with shortest paths.
