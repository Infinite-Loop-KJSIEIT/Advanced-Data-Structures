Among all the numbers entered by the user, this programme prints those which are prime numbers.

The purpose of this programme is to illustrate the basic syntax, working and implementation of the std::find() function for searching through a composite data structure.

The find() function returns an iterator to the first occurence of the queried value.
If the value is absent, the returned iterator points to the end.

find() is an optimized searching algorithm which is very useful to search through various data structures.

The performance of this programme is optimized by reducing the overhead of populating the vector of prime numbers again and again.
We populate the vector only up to the largest odd number and search through it to find any hits for prime numbers entered by the user.
