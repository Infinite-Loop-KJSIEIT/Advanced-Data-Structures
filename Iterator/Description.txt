This programme prints all the prime numbers less than the value entered by the user.

The purpose of this programme is to illustrate the basic syntax, working and implementation of vectors as well as iterators.

Iterators are specifically designed data types that are used to iterate over every element of a composite data structure.
They behave similar to the pointer to an individual element of the data structure.
They are highly specific in nature and are sensitive to their declaration.

E.g. a std::vector<int>::iterator may not be used to iterate over a std::vector<float>.

Vectors are very useful composite data structures with a powerful library for performing various operations such as searching and sorting.

This programme is intended to illustrate the working of an iterator. Hence, it may not have an optimal performance.
The performance of this programme can be greatly optimized by combining the steps for checking, inserting and printing prime numbers.
