This programme implements a simple Caesar Cipher. To simplify the implementation, its scope has been limited only to the lower case words (without spaces).

The purpose of this programme is to illustrate the basic syntax, working and implementation of the std::map composite data structure.

std::map is an instrinsically sorted data structure comprising of two values: key value and mapped value.
It is essentially a std::pair<key_type, mapped_value_type>.
The key attribute of the std::map can be used exactly like the index of an array. Thus, the data structure is intrinsically sorted.

The Caesar Cipher is a simple cipher that displaces the position of each character in the alphabet by a constant offset value.
The plaintext can be obtained by subtracting this offset.

The performance of this programme can be optimized and improved by including symbols, upper case characters as well as spaces.
